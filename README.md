# AI Professor Debate System (Based on AutoGen/SmolEAgent)

## 1. Introduction
This system utilizes AutoGen and SmolEAgent to implement AI professor debates, incorporating PDF RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Web search to enhance knowledge sources, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in the debate process.

## 2. Key Components
### 2.1 AutoGen
- **Multi-Agent System**: Allows multiple AI agents to take on roles such as professor, student, and judge.
- **Task Adaptation**: Dynamically adjusts the agents' behavior based on the debate topic.

### 2.2 SmolEAgent
- **Lightweight AI Agent**: Suitable for embedded environments and works collaboratively with AutoGen.
- **Modular Design**: Allows for adding different reasoning capabilities as needed.

### 2.3 PDF RAG
- **Document Retrieval**: Enables AI agents to query relevant content from academic PDFs.
- **Context Enhancement**: Uses retrieved content to supplement AI-generated responses.

### 2.4 Web Search
- **Real-Time Information Retrieval**: Ensures that AI agents base their arguments on the latest knowledge.
- **Result Filtering**: Avoids misinformation or inaccurate data affecting the debate.

## 3. Workflow
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96b91b3d-eb4c-4a24-908c-a8d8cc478124)

1. **Input Debate Topic**
   - The user or system defines the debate topic.
2. **Retrieve Relevant Data**
   - PDF RAG searches academic literature.
   - Web search fetches the latest related information.
3. **AI Role Assignment**
   - AI Professor A: Supports the argument.
   - AI Professor B: Opposes the argument.
   - AI Judge: Evaluates the validity of both arguments or stop the action.
4. **Debate Process**
   - AI professors take turns presenting their points.
   - Arguments can be dynamically adjusted based on new information.
5. **Final Evaluation**
   - The AI judge assesses the content quality and persuasiveness of the arguments.
   
## 4. Potential Applications
- **Academic Discussions**
- **Legal Debate Simulations**
- **Policy Analysis**
- **Student AI Interaction for Debate Training**




## 5. Future Expansion
- **Multilingual Support**
- **Integration of Knowledge Graphs for Better Reasoning**
- **Integration with Academic Databases (e.g., Arxiv, Google Scholar)"

## 6. quickstart( to be continued)
